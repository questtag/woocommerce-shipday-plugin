== Description ==
Enable fast local deliveries for your online store or marketplace with Shipday. Easy driver and dispatch app with live delivery tracking. Built-in connection with on-demand delivery services like DoorDash and Uber in the US.

Use the Shipday Integration for WooCommerce plugin to create connection with [Shipday](https://www.shipday.com/).

So that, when a customer places any delivery order on your WooCommerce website, the order will be automatically imported to Shipday for dispatch and delivery tracking. 

After installation, add your Shipday API configuration in the plugin to allow your site to send order details to the Shipday dispatch dashboard. You'll find the settings under: WooCommerce > Settings > Shipday
